**Predictions** are fundamental to finance. To be more specific, in applications, fund managers require a prediction machine to precisely estimate the future prices of assets, which is utilized to generate decisions and actions. Therefore, the quality of the predictions determines the overall performance of a fund manager. It is also the most vital challenge for all investors in the market. Besides, customers of the fund generally have doubts about the consistency of the predictions. For customers, one of the major features of a fund is whether the manager could explicitly illustrate the motivation and intuition behind the prediction machine. A better explanation of the predictions can attract more customers and convince them to not withdraw when a large dropdown happens.
