abstract: Deep generative models (DGMs) have shown strong performance in
  semi-supervised learning (SSL), which incorporate discrete class information
  into the learning process. Yet existing methods generally overfit to the given
  labeled data, for only considering the conditional probability of labels. In
  this paper, we propose a novel discriminative regularized deep generative
  method for SSL, which fully exploits the discriminative and geometric
  information of data to address the aforementioned issue. Our method introduces
  the cluster and manifold assumption that maximizes the classification margin
  between clusters and simultaneously smooths the predictions of the data which
  is close in the sub-manifold of each cluster, to regularize the learning of
  the classifier in DGMs. To derive the regularization based on introduced
  assumptions, we adopt the generated data of DGMs along with labelled and
  unlabelled data, to model the data manifold and yield clusters based on the
  Gumbel-softmax distribution. Experimental results on both text and image
  datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our method, and
  prove that two introduced assumptions are complementary in guiding the
  classification boundary, thus improving the discriminative ability of the
  classifier.
