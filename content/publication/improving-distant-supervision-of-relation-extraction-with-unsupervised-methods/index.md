abstract: Distant supervision has been widely adopted in relation extraction
  task since it does not require any labeled data. It can automatically align
  knowledge base with corpus to generate training data. However, the intuition
  base of alignment in this method may fail, resulting in wrong label problem.
  In this paper, we try to improve the intuition of distant supervision from the
  perspective of relation mentions, and propose a novel method called Clustered
  DS which employs our improved intuition in an unsupervised manner. By
  incorporating the information about the distribution of relation mentions, our
  method achieves a more precise alignment, thus it significantly reduces the
  number of wrong labels. Experimental results demonstrate the advantage of
  Clustered DS over existing distant supervision methods and show the
  effectiveness of our improved intuition.
