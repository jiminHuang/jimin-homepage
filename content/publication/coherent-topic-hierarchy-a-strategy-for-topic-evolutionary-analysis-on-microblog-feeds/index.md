abstract: Topic evolutionary analysis on microblog feeds can help reveal usersâ€™
  interests and public concerns in a global perspective. However, it is not easy
  to capture the evolutionary patterns since the semantic coherence is usually
  difficult to be expressed and the timeline structure is always intractable to
  be organized. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy, in which a coherent
  topic hierarchy is designed to deal with these challenges. First, we
  incorporate the sparse biterm topic model to extract some coherent topics from
  microblog feeds. Then the topology of these topics is constructed by the basic
  Bayesian rose tree combined with topic similarity. Finally, we devise a
  cross-tree random walk with restart model to bond each pair of sequential
  trees into a timeline hierarchy. Experimental results on microblog datasets
  demonstrate that the coherent topic hierarchy is capable of providing
  meaningful topic interpretations, achieving high clustering performance, as
  well as presenting motivated patterns for topic evolutionary analysis.
