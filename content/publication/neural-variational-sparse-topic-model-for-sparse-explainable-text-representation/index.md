abstract: "Texts are the major information carrier for internet users, from
  which learning the latent representations has important research and practical
  value. Neural topic models have been proposed and have great performance in
  extracting interpretable latent topics and representations of texts. However,
  there remain two major limitations: (1) these methods generally ignore the
  contextual information of texts and have limited feature representation
  ability due to the shallow feed-forward network architecture, (2) Sparsity of
  the representations in topic semantic space is ignored. To address these
  issues, in this paper, we propose a semantic reinforcement neural variational
  sparse topic model (SR-NSTM) towards explainable and sparse latent text
  representation learning. Compared with existing neural topic models, SR-NSTM
  models the generative process of texts with probabilistic distributions
  parameterized with neural networks and incorporates Bi-directional LSTM to
  embed contextual information at the document level. It achieves sparse
  posterior representations over documents and words with zero-mean Laplace
  distribution and topics with sparsemax. Moreover, we propose a supervised
  extension of SR-NSTM via adding the max-margin posterior regularization to
  tackle the supervised tasks. The neural variational inference method is
  utilized to learn our models efficiently. Experimental results on Web
  Snippets, 20Newsgroups, BBC, and Biomedical datasets demonstrate that the
  contextual information and revisiting generative process can improve the
  performance, leading to the competitive performance of our models in learning
  coherent topics and explainable sparse representations for texts."
