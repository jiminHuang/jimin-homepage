abstract: Learning low-dimensional representations of networked documents is a
  crucial task for documents linked in network structures. Relational Topic
  Models (RTMs) have shown their strengths in modeling both document contents
  and relations to discover the latent topic semantic representations. However,
  higher-order correlation structure information among documents is largely
  ignored in these methods. Therefore, we propose a novel graph relational topic
  model (GRTM) for document network, to fully explore and mix neighborhood
  information of documents on each order, based on the Higher-order Graph
  Attention Network (HGAT) with the log-normal prior in the graph attention. The
  proposed method can address the aforementioned issue via the information
  propagation among document-document based on the HGAT probabilistic encoder,
  to learn efficient networked document representations in the latent topic
  space, which can fully reflect document contents, along with document
  connections. Experiments on several real-world document network datasets show
  that, through fully exploring information in documents and document networks,
  our model achieves better performance on unsupervised representation learning
  and outperforms existing competitive methods in various downstream tasks.
