abstract: "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) such as GCN can effectively learn
  document representations via the semantic relation graph among documents and
  words. However, despite a few exceptions, most of the previous work in this
  line of research does not consider the underlying topical semantics inherited
  in document contents and the relation graph, making the representations less
  effective and hard to interpret. In a few recent studies trying to incorporate
  latent topics into GNNs, the topics have been learned independently from the
  relation graph modeling. Intuitively, topic extraction can benefit much from
  the information propagation of the relation graph structure - directly and
  indirectly connected documents and words have similar topics. In this paper,
  we propose a novel Graph Topic Neural Network (GTNN) model to mine latent
  topic semantics for interpretable document representation learning, taking
  into account the document-document, document-word, and word-word relationships
  in the graph. We also show that our model can be viewed as semi-amortized
  inference for relational topic model based on Poisson distribution, with high
  order correlations. We test our model in several settings: unsupervised,
  semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning, for both connected
  and unconnected documents. In all the cases, our model outperforms the
  state-of-the-art models for these tasks."
