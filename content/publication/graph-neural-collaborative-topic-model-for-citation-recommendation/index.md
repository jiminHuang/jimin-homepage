abstract: Due to the overload of published scientific articles, citation
  recommendation has long been a critical research problem for automatically
  recommending the most relevant citations of given articles. Relational topic
  models (RTMs) have shown promise on citation prediction via joint modeling of
  document contents and citations. However, existing RTMs can only capture
  pairwise or direct (first-order) citation relationships among documents. The
  indirect (high-order) citation links have been explored in graph neural
  networkâ€“based methods, but these methods suffer from the well-known
  explainability problem. In this article, we propose a model called Graph
  Neural Collaborative Topic Model that takes advantage of both relational topic
  models and graph neural networks to capture high-order citation relationships
  and to have higher explainability due to the latent topic semantic structure.
  Experiments on three real-world citation datasets show that our model
  outperforms several competitive baseline methods on citation recommendation.
  In addition, we show that our approach can learn better topics than the
  existing approaches. The recommendation results can be well explained by the
  underlying topics.
